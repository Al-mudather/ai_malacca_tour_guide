// notes:
 - now let's work step-by-step.
- Read the codes first to understand the flow.
- Maintain the same logic and only add or make the nessasery changes.

//todos:
- ask the llm to give the itinerary a title.
-ask the llm to rturn the place location(lat,lung) so the place can be view in the map.
- ask the llm to return resturant also , so the user can have food.
- Make the palces unique in the databse by the place name, so they will not be any dublicate places.
- If the user update his plan in the valid date range by asking for new places, update the itinerary table also .
- Use leaflet map instead of google map.
- In the itinerary details , if the user activated a day he must be able to see the palaces in the map.
- Show the user his current location on the map.
- Show the user the route to the places in the map.
